# Adventure Works--Sales Performance Analysis


## Project Overview
In this project, I will be sharing with you the exploratory data analysis that i carried out on the Adventure works database. 

Adventure works is a multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes bicycles, parts, and accessories for commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. By carrying out this analysis, we will help the company improve its service performance and better serve its customers.

To carry out this exploratory data analysis, I will be using the AdventureWorks 2022 database. I analyzed data from dim_customers_table, dim_date_table, dim_product_table, dim_territory_sales and fact_internet_sales table. I used SQL to query the data from the database and imported into PowerBI where the actual analysis was carried out.

The project aims to analyze sales and customer data from the AdventureWorks2022 database, with the sole intent of identifying trends and patterns that can inform business strategy and decision-making.

EDA involved exploring the data and answering key business questions such as:

Business Questions:

- North America is the location(group) that has the highest sales which is 38.7%, followed by Pacific at 30.84%.

- "Bikes" account for majority of the sales and profit of $11.5 Million which is 95.4%. Accessory as a subcategory is the product with the greatest number of orders but lower revenue, this is due to price gap between both and for the fact that several accessories can be used to fix a damaged bike.
- Clothing and Accessories pose the best potential in terms of profitability and market expansion.

- USA has the highest sales and order. Sales is $9.37milllion which is approximately 32% of total sales and 35% of total order. This is followed by Australia which has a sales value of $9.04 million.

- Total Sales increases when the Category is Bike and also when the order quantity is much. Total Sales decreases when Category is Clothing or Accessories.
